						## About Go
						[Go](https://golang.org/) is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Notable Companies Using Go
						- Google / Facebook / Yahoo
						- Rackspace / Digital Ocean / Heroku
						- Shopify / Booking.com / Medium
						- IBM / Comcast / Canonical
						- Square
						- SendGrid / Bitly
						- Docker
						- Dropbox
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Why Go?
						- Simple
						- Maintainable
						- Easily generated documentation
						- Opinionated project structure
						- Opinionated formatting rules
						- Robust tooling
						- Scales easily
						- Single, static binary
						- Fast compile times
						- Easily cross platform
						- Good community
						- Language level concurrency (no callback hell)
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Why not Go?
						- No generics
						- No operator overloading
						- Inelegant
						- Ugly syntax
						- Poor dependency management
						- Garbage collector can not be modified easily
						- Verbose error handling
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Installation
						## OSX
						```bash
						brew update
						brew install go
						```
						### Linux
						Download binary from https://golang.org/dl/
						```bash
						wget https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.6.linux-amd64.tar.gz
						sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.6.linux-amd64.tar.gz
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Paths
						Add the following to your `.profile`. This will add the binaries to your PATH and also setup your GOPATH environment
						```bash
						export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
						export GOPATH=$HOME/work
						```
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Tooling
						Go comes with its own tool, called `go`. It manages many things, but dependency management is the main thing missing.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Go tool
						The `go` tool can handle fetching dependencies, running tests, installing binaries, running programs, linting, code formatting, and many other things!
						```bash
						build       compile packages and dependencies
						clean       remove object files
						env         print Go environment information
						fix         run go tool fix on packages
						fmt         run gofmt on package sources
						get         download and install packages and dependencies
						install     compile and install packages and dependencies
						list        list packages
						run         compile and run Go program
						test        test packages
						tool        run specified go tool
						version     print Go version
						vet         run go tool vet on packages
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Third Party Tools
						The third party tooling is very good considering how young Go is. Many of the tools are built in Go, and write to stdout so can be easily parsed and plugged into any editors easily.

						A short list of essential third party tools are:
						```bash
						glide        Dependency Management
						gocode       Allows package inspection for autocompletion
						golint       Linting for go source code
						godef        Go to definition
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Using Go
						The commands `go get`, `go build`, `go run`, and `go test` will probably be your most commonly used commands.

						## Cross compilation
						To cross compile to a different system architecture, prefix with the environment variable.

						Cross compiling for Windows from OSX:
						```plain
						GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build main.go
						```

						## Program Flow
						Methods to control the program flow is similar to C based languages
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Conditionals
						Methods to control the program flow is similar to C based languages
						```go
						if condition {
							// Do something
						}

						if a := something; condition {
							// Assign a variable or run a function then do something
						}
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Select
						The select statement lets a goroutine wait on multiple communication operations.
						```go
						for i := 0; i < 2; i++ {
							select {
								case msg1 := <- c1:
									fmt.Println("received", msg1)
								case msg2 := <- c2:
									fmt.Println("received", msg2)
							}
						}
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Switch
						These statements express conditionals across many branches.
						```go
						i := 2
						fmt.Print("write ", i, " as ")
						switch i {
							case 1:
							fmt.Println("one")
							case 2:
							fmt.Println("two")
							case 3:
							fmt.Println("three")
						}
						```
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						# Loops
						There is only a single type of loop
						```go
						for initialization; condition; post {
							// Vanilla loop
						}

						for condition {
							// While loop
						}

						for {
							// Infinite loop
						}
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Range
						Iterable objects can also be `range`d over:
						```go
						a := [1, 2, 3]
						for _, v := range a {
							fmt.Println(v)
						}
						```
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Program Structure
						Go has a very opinionated structure. There are tools around this but it is a better idea to follow best practices.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## GOPATH
						The GOPATH is where everything is stored. The GOPATH has the following tree:
						```bash
						$GOPATH
						├── bin
							└── gocode
							└── goimports
							└── goreturns
						├── pkg
							└── darwin_amd64
								└── github.com
									└── nii236
										└── repo-name
						└── src
							└── github.com
								└── nii236
									└── repo-name
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Packages
						These are basically libraries or modules in other languages and is namespaced. Exported identifiers in each package allows users to consume the packages as intended.

						Packages are fetched with `go get` and are imported with a fully qualified name and will fetch the HEAD everytime.

						```go
						import "github.com/exampleUser/exampleRepo"
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Vendoring
						Since Go 1.5, there has been support for vendoring and dependency management (which allows us to control which versions of packages we fetch).

						There have been many third party tools created for this, as the creators of Go do not see it as necessary (as they live in Google's monorepo environment):
						- gb
						- godep
						- glide
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Exported and Unexported Identifiers
						If the first letter of a function is a capital, then it is considered an exported identifier and can be accessed from outside the package.

						If the first letter is lowercase instead, it will be considered private.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Variables
						There are a few ways of declaring variables.
						```go
						var a, b, c int
						var i, j, k = true, 2.3, "four"
						f, err := os.Open(name)
						```

					</section>
				</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Types
						Go's type system is very simplistic and not easily extensible.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Data Types
						- Integers
						- Floats
						- Complex Numbers
						- Booleans
						- Strings
						- Constants
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Composite Types
						- Arrays
						- Slices
						- Maps
						- Struct
						- JSON
						- Text and HTML Templates
					</section>

						## Structs
						These are a very important part of Go and are worth focusing on.

						Structs are typed collections of fields.

						Structs are also what enables Go's composition based object oriented programming.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Struct Example
						Here is a struct declaration of a Person containing a Name of type string, and an Age of type int.
						```go
						type Person struct {
							Name string
							Age  int
						}
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Instantiating Structs
						You refer to struct objects with their memory address when assigning to a variable
						```go
						func main() {
							p := &Person{"John", 29}
							fmt.Println(p.Name)
						}
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Embedding Structs
						```go
						type Person struct {
							Name string
							Age  int
						}

						type Developer struct {
							Person
							Company	string
						}

						type Student struct {
							Person
							University string
						}
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Attaching Methods
						```go
						func (p *Person) sayHello() {
							fmt.Println("Hello")
						}

						func (d *Developer) sayHello() {
							fmt.Println("BeepBoop")
						}

						func main() {
							p := &Person{"Andy", 32}
							d := &Developer{Person{"John", 29}, "TFG"}
							p.sayHello()
							d.sayHello()
						}
						```

						```bash
						$ go run main.go
						Hello
						BeepBoop
						```
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Procedures
						Go allows both functions and methods with collections of functions passed around as interfaces.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Functions
						Go supports first class functions that do not need to be attached or instantiated from a class/object
						```go
						func exampleFunction(varName string) []int, error {
							...
						}
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Methods
						Go also allows you to attach methods to structs
						```go
						func (s *SomeStruct) exampleMethod(a int) int {
							...
						}
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Interfaces
						Collections of methods are called interfaces, and these are satisfied **implicitly**. So if you attach the right methods to a struct to satisfy an interface you may use that struct as an argument wherever that interface is used!
						```go
						type ExampleInterface interface {
							methodOne(in string) string
							methodTwo(in []int) int, error
						}

						type First struct { RandomInfo string}
						type Second struct { OtherInfo int}
						func (s *First) methodOne(a int) int {}
						func (s *First) methodTwo(a int) int {}
						func (s *Second) methodOne(a int) int {}
						func (s *Second) methodTwo(a int) int {}

						func satisfied (ex ExampleInterface) {
							// Either first or second struct can be used!
						}
						```
					</section>

						## Hello World
						We're going to start with a simple hello world program.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Hello World
						The below code will get you going:
						```go
						package main

						import "fmt"

						func main() {
							fmt.Println("Hello, 世界")
						}
						```

						To run it:
						```
						$ go run main.go
						Hello, 世界
						```
					</section>

						## Command Line Tools
						Let's have a look at parsing command line flags. Go is quite good at building command line tools.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Command Line Tool Example
						```go
						func main() {
						    var cmd string

						    flag.StringVar(&cmd, "cmd", cmd, `cmd can be either "hello" or "bye"`)
						    flag.Parse()

						    switch cmd {
						    case "hello":
						        fmt.Println("Hello!")
						    case "bye":
						        fmt.Println("Bye!")
						    default:
						        flag.Usage()
						    }
						}
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Lets build it first then run it.

						```bash
						$ go build main.go
						$ ./go-crashcourse
						Usage of ./go-crashcourse:
						  -cmd string
						    	cmd can be either "hello" or "bye"
						```

						## Concurrency
						Go has two main forms of managing concurrency. Goroutines and Channels.

					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Go Routines
						Go routines are light weight threads that are managed by the Go runtime.
						To run a function in a new go routine, just put "go" before the function call.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Go routine example
						```
						func main() {
							go say("let's go!", 3*time.Second)
							go say("ho!", 2*time.Second)
							go say("hey!", 1*time.Second)

							time.Sleep(4 * time.Second)
							fmt.Println("Finished")
						}
						func say(text string, delay time.Duration) {
							time.Sleep(delay)
							fmt.Println(text)
						}
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Channels
						Channels are typed conduits for synchronization and communication between go routines.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Go channel example
						```go
						func main() {
							messages := make(chan string)
							go func() {messages <- "ping"}()
							msg := <- messages
							fmt.Println(msg)
						}
						```
					</section>
				</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Web Client and Server
						Go has a very solid standard library and its common in the community to focus on solving most problems with the standard library.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Client
						The net/http package provides an HTTP client.
						```
						func main() {
						    r, err := http.Get("http://www.golang.org/")
						    if err != nil {
						        log.Fatal(err)
						    }
						    if r.StatusCode != http.StatusOK {
						        log.Fatal(r.Status)
						    }
						    io.Copy(os.Stdout, r.Body)
						}
						```
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Server
						The net/http package also provides an HTTP server.
						```
						func main() {
						    http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
						        fmt.Fprint(w, "Hello, web")
						    })

						    fmt.Println("Starting server")
						    err := http.ListenAndServe("localhost:8080", nil)
						    if err != nil {
						        log.Fatal(err)
						    }
						}
						```
						This is a high-performance, DoS-hardened, production-ready web server.
						It serves dl.google.com
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Testing
						Go has a robust standard tooling for table based XUnit type tests. Additional third party libraries are available for more BDD style assertions.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Testing Example

						First we will build the test suite.
						```go
						package add_test

						import (
							"testing"

							"github.com/nii236/gotraining/testing"
						)

						var tests = []struct {
							in  []int
							out int
						}{
							{[]int{1, 2}, 3},
							{[]int{-1, 2}, 1},
							{[]int{1, 0}, 1},
						}
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Next we will write the test itself:

						```go
						func TestFunc(t *testing.T) {
							for _, tt := range tests {
								got := add.Do(tt.in[0], tt.in[1])
								expected := tt.out
								if got != tt.out {
									t.Errorf("Error! Got %d, expected %d", got, expected)
								}

							}
						}

						```

					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Testing Example Continued
						Next we will write the code that satisfies the test:

						```go
						package add

						//Do runs a test func given two integers
						func Do(a int, b int) int {
							return a + b
						}
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Testing Example Continued
						Now we can run the test and see how we go!
						```bash
						$ go test
						```
					</section>
				</section>
