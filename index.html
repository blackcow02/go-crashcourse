						## About Go
						[Go](https://golang.org/) is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Notable Companies Using Go
						- Google / Facebook / Yahoo
						- Rackspace / Digital Ocean / Heroku
						- Shopify / Booking.com / Medium
						- IBM / Comcast / Canonical
						- Square
						- SendGrid / Bitly
						- Docker
						- Dropbox
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Why Go?
						- Simple
						- Maintainable
						- Scales easily
						- Easily generated documentation
						- Fast
						- Robust tooling
						- Single, static binary
						- Fast compile times
						- Cross platform
						- Good community
						- Language level concurrency (no callback hell)
						- Useful error messages
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Why not Go?
						- No generics
						- No operator overloading
						- Inelegant
						- Ugly syntax
						- Poor dependency management
						- Garbage collector can not be modified easily
						- Verbose error handling
					</section>
				</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Installation
						### OSX
						```bash
						brew update
						brew install go
						```
						### Linux
						Download binary from [https://golang.org/dl/]()
						```bash
						wget https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.6.linux-amd64.tar.gz
						sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.6.linux-amd64.tar.gz
						```

						### Web
						Visit [https://play.golang.org/]().
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Paths
						Add the following to your `.profile`. This will add the binaries to your PATH and also setup your GOPATH environment
						```bash
						export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
						export GOPATH=$HOME/work
						```
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Tooling
						Go comes with its own tool, called `go`. It manages many things, and any missing functionality can be covered with third party tools.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Go tool
						The `go` tool can handle fetching dependencies, running tests, installing binaries, running programs, linting, code formatting, and many others!
						```bash
						build       compile packages and dependencies
						clean       remove object files
						env         print Go environment information
						fix         run go tool fix on packages
						fmt         run gofmt on package sources
						get         download and install packages and dependencies
						install     compile and install packages and dependencies
						list        list packages
						run         compile and run Go program
						test        test packages
						tool        run specified go tool
						version     print Go version
						vet         run go tool vet on packages
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Documentation
						The Go project cares a lot about documentation, and `golint` enforces clean code that can be parsed for generation of documentation.

						The `godoc` tool can parse code to render documentation to stdout.
						```bash
						$ godoc fmt Formatter
						use 'godoc cmd/fmt' for documentation on the fmt command

						type Formatter interface {
							Format(f State, c rune)
						}
						Formatter is the interface implemented by values with a custom
						formatter. The implementation of Format may call
						Sprint(f) or Fprint(f) etc. to generate its output.
						```
						The `godoc` tool also contains a webserver!
						```bash
						$ godoc -http=":8082"
						$ open http://localhost:8082
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Third Party Tools
						The third party tooling is very good considering how young Go is. Many of the tools are built in Go, and write to stdout so can be easily parsed and plugged into any editors easily.

						A short list of essential third party tools are:
						```bash
						glide        Dependency Management
						gocode       Allows package inspection for autocompletion
						golint       Linting for go source code
						godef        Go to definition
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Using Go
						The commands `go get`, `go build`, `go run`, and `go test` will probably be your most commonly used commands.

						## Cross compilation
						To cross compile to a different system architecture, prefix with the relevant environment variables.

						Cross compiling for Windows from OSX:
						```bash
						GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build main.go
						```

					<section data-markdown>
						## Program Structure
						Go has a very opinionated structure. There are tools around this but it is a better idea to follow best practices.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## GOPATH
						The GOPATH is where everything is stored. The GOPATH has the following tree:
						```bash
						$GOPATH
						├── bin
							└── gocode
							└── goimports
							└── goreturns
						├── pkg
							└── darwin_amd64
								└── github.com
									└── nii236
										└── repo-name
						└── src
							└── github.com
								└── nii236
									└── repo-name
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Packages
						These are basically libraries or modules in other languages and is namespaced. Exported identifiers in each package allows users to consume the packages as intended.

						Packages are fetched with `go get` and are imported with a fully qualified name and will fetch the HEAD everytime.

						```go
						import "github.com/exampleUser/exampleRepo"
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Vendoring
						Since Go 1.5, there has been support for vendoring and dependency management (which allows us to control which versions of packages we fetch).

						There have been many third party tools created for this, as the creators of Go do not see it as necessary (as they live in Google's monorepo environment):
						- [gb](https://getgb.io/)
						- [godep](https://github.com/tools/godep)
						- [glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide)
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Exported and Unexported Identifiers
						If the first letter of a function is a capital, then it is considered an exported identifier and can be accessed from outside the package.
						```go
						// ExportedFunction is a function that is
						// accessible outside of the package
						func ExportedFunction() {}
						```

						If the first letter is lowercase instead, it will be considered private.
						```go
						func unexportedFunction() {}
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Variables
						There are a few ways of declaring variables.
						```go
						var a, b, c int
						var i, j, k = true, 2.3, "four"
						f, err := os.Open(name)
						```

					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Program Flow
						[Link](https://play.golang.org/p/iozXXYlnZ6)

						Methods to control the program flow is similar to C based languages
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Conditionals
						Methods to control the program flow is similar to C based languages
						```go
						if condition {
							// Do something
						}

						if a := something; condition {
							// Assign a variable or run a function then do something
						}
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Select
						The select statement lets a goroutine wait on multiple communication operations.
						```go
						for i := 0; i < 2; i++ {
							select {
								case msg1 := <- c1:
									fmt.Println("received", msg1)
								case msg2 := <- c2:
									fmt.Println("received", msg2)
							}
						}
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Switch
						These statements express conditionals across many branches.
						```go
						i := 2
						fmt.Print("write ", i, " as ")
						switch i {
							case 1:
							fmt.Println("one")
							case 2:
							fmt.Println("two")
							case 3:
							fmt.Println("three")
						}
						```
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Loops
						There is only a single type of loop
						```go
						for initialization; condition; post {
							// Vanilla loop
						}

						for condition {
							// While loop
						}

						for {
							// Infinite loop
						}
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Range
						Iterable objects can also be `range`d over:
						```go
						a := [1, 2, 3]
						for _, v := range a {
							fmt.Println(v)
						}
						```
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Types
						Go's type system is very simplistic and not easily extensible.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Data Types
						- Integers
						- Floats
						- Complex Numbers
						- Booleans
						- Strings
						- Constants
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Composite Types
						- Arrays
						- Slices
						- Maps
						- Struct
						- JSON
						- Text and HTML Templates
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Structs
						[Link](https://play.golang.org/p/OS7G3Zl2A7)

						These are a very important part of Go and are worth focusing on.

						Structs are typed collections of fields.

						Structs are also what enables Go's composition based object oriented programming.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Struct Example
						Here is a struct declaration of a Person containing a Name of type string, and an Age of type int.
						```go
						type Person struct {
							Name string
							Age  int
						}
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Instantiating Structs
						You refer to struct objects with their memory address when assigning to a variable
						```go
						func main() {
							p := &Person{"John", 29}
							fmt.Println(p.Name)
						}
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Embedding Structs
						Go does not provide the typical, type-driven notion of subclassing, but it does have the ability to “borrow” pieces of an implementation by embedding types within a struct or interface.
						```go
						type Person struct {
							Name string
							Age  int
						}

						type Developer struct {
							Person
							Company	string
						}

						type Student struct {
							Person
							University string
						}
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Attaching Methods
						Use struct pointers if you need to mutate the object itself.
						```go
						func (p Person) sayHello() {
							fmt.Println("Hello")
						}

						func (d Developer) sayHello() {
							fmt.Println("BeepBoop")
						}

						func main() {
							p := &Person{"Andy", 32}
							d := &Developer{Person{"John", 29}, "TFG"}
							p.sayHello()
							d.sayHello()
						}
						```

						```bash
						$ go run main.go
						Hello
						BeepBoop
						```
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Procedures
						Go allows both functions and methods with collections of functions passed around as interfaces.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Functions
						Go supports first class functions that do not need to be attached or instantiated from a class/object

						Functions in Go can have *multiple return values*
						```go
						func exampleFunction(varName string) ([]int, error) {
							...
						}
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Anonymous Functions
						[Link](https://play.golang.org/p/0tOpD0O1p8)

						Go supports anonymous functions.

						They can also be used as a return value given the same function signature.
						```go
						// AnonymousFunc is an anonymous function type
						// that can be used as a return value.
						type AnonymousFunc func() []int

						// Parentfunc simply returns AnonymousFunc.
						func Parentfunc() AnonymousFunc {
							return func() []int {
								return []int{1, 2}
							}
						}
						```

						This can be useful for creating wrappers around functions such as building middleware for HTTP handlers.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Methods
						Go also allows you to attach methods to structs
						```go
						func (s *SomeStruct) exampleMethod(a int) int {
							...
						}
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Interfaces
						[Link](https://play.golang.org/p/F6ZCguKs55)

						Interfaces in Go provide a way to specify the behavior of an object: if something can do *this*, then it can be used here.

						Interfaces are satisfied **implicitly**.

						```go
						type ExampleInterface interface {
							methodOne(in string) string
							methodTwo(in []int) (int, error)
						}
						type First struct { RandomInfo string}
						type Second struct { OtherInfo int}

						func (s *First) methodOne(a int) string {}
						func (s *First) methodTwo(a int) (int, error)

						func (s *Second) methodOne(a int) string {}
						func (s *Second) methodTwo(a int) (int, error) {}

						func satisfied (ex ExampleInterface) {
							// Either first or second struct can be used!
						}
						```
					</section>
				</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Hello World
						We're going to start with a simple hello world program.

					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Hello World Example
						[Link](https://play.golang.org/p/I3l_5RKJts)

						The below code will get you going:
						```go
						package main

						import "fmt"

						func main() {
							fmt.Println("Hello, 世界")
						}
						```

						To run it:
						```
						$ go run main.go
						Hello, 世界
						```
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Command Line Tools
						Let's have a look at parsing command line flags. Go is quite good at building command line tools.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Command Line Tool Example
						```go
						func main() {
						    var cmd string

						    flag.StringVar(&cmd, "cmd", cmd, `cmd can be either "hello" or "bye"`)
						    flag.Parse()

						    switch cmd {
						    case "hello":
						        fmt.Println("Hello!")
						    case "bye":
						        fmt.Println("Bye!")
						    default:
						        flag.Usage()
						    }
						}
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Lets build it first then run it.

						```bash
						$ go build main.go
						$ ./go-crashcourse
						Usage of ./go-crashcourse:
						  -cmd string
						    	cmd can be either "hello" or "bye"
						```
					</section>
				</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Concurrency
						Go has two main forms of managing concurrency. Goroutines and Channels.

					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Go Routines
						Go routines are light weight threads that are managed by the Go runtime.
						To run a function in a new go routine, just put "go" before the function call.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Go routine example

						[Link](https://play.golang.org/p/W51Ls4Tlsu)

						```
						// Routines is an example of Go routines.
						func Routines() {
							go say("let's go!", 3*time.Second)
							go say("ho!", 2*time.Second)
							go say("hey!", 1*time.Second)

							time.Sleep(4 * time.Second)
							fmt.Println("Finished")
						}

						func say(text string, delay time.Duration) {
							time.Sleep(delay)
							fmt.Println(text)
						}
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Channels
						Channels are typed conduits for synchronization and communication between go routines.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Go channel example
						[Link](https://play.golang.org/p/a8ka_5zoEG)
						```go
						// Channels is an example of Go channels.
						func Channels() {
							messages := make(chan string)
							go func() { messages <- "ping" }()
							msg := <-messages
							fmt.Println(msg)
						}
						```
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Web Client and Server
						Go has a very solid standard library and its common in the community to focus on solving most problems with the standard library.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Client
						The net/http package provides an HTTP client.
						```
						func main() {
						    r, err := http.Get("http://www.golang.org/")
						    if err != nil {
						        log.Fatal(err)
						    }
						    if r.StatusCode != http.StatusOK {
						        log.Fatal(r.Status)
						    }
						    io.Copy(os.Stdout, r.Body)
						}
						```
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Server
						The net/http package also provides an HTTP server.
						```
						func main() {
						    http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
						        fmt.Fprint(w, "Hello, web")
						    })

						    fmt.Println("Starting server")
						    err := http.ListenAndServe("localhost:8080", nil)
						    if err != nil {
						        log.Fatal(err)
						    }
						}
						```
						This is a high-performance, DoS-hardened and production-ready web server.
						It serves [dl.google.com](http://dl.google.com).
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Server with Templated HTML
						We will need to fetch our first dependency for this code.
						```bash
						go get github.com/gorilla/mux
						```
						The code below creates a webserver that handles only a single route, `/`, unlike before.
						```go
						import "github.com/gorilla/mux"

						// PartTwo runs a web server with templating
						func PartTwo() {
							rt := mux.NewRouter().StrictSlash(true)
							// Index is described in the slide below
							rt.HandleFunc("/", Index)
							log.Println("PART TWO: Starting server of localhost:8081")
							log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8081", rt))
						}
						```

						The route handler Index will be handled next.
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Route Handlers

						`Index` will be executed when the route `/` is hit.

						```go
						//Index is the handler for root path
						func Index(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
							pd := PageData{
								Title: "Index Page",
								Body:  "This is the body of the page",
							}

							tmpl, err := htmlTemplate(pd)

							if err != nil {
								w.WriteHeader(http.StatusBadRequest)
								w.Write([]byte(err.Error()))
								return
							}
							w.Write([]byte(tmpl))
						}
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Templating

						HTML templating is a powerful feature of Go and lets you render data-driven HTML.

						As of Go 1.6, blocks are introduced which let you build templates on other templates.

						```go
						func htmlTemplate(pd PageData) (string, error) {
							html := `&ltHTML&gt
						&lthead&gt
							&lttitle&gt
								{{.Title}}
							&lt/title&gt
						&lt/head&gt
						&ltbody&gt
							{{.Body}}
						&lt/body&gt
						`

							tmpl, err := template.New("index").Parse(html)
							if err != nil {
								return "", err
							}

							var out bytes.Buffer

							if err := tmpl.Execute(&out, pd); err != nil {
								return "", err
							}

							return out.String(), nil
						}
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Now we can update our CLI tool and execute our server.
						```bash
						$ go build
						./go-crashcourse -cmd serve2
						Running server!
						2016/03/04 10:57:19 PART TWO: Starting server of localhost:8081
						```
						Next we visit [localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)
						```bash
						open http://localhost:8081
						```
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Testing
						Go has a robust standard tooling for table based XUnit type tests. Additional third party libraries are available for more BDD style assertions.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Testing Example

						First we will build the test suite.
						```go
						package add_test

						import (
							"testing"

							"github.com/nii236/gotraining/testing"
						)

						var tests = []struct {
							in  []int
							out int
						}{
							{[]int{1, 2}, 3},
							{[]int{-1, 2}, 1},
							{[]int{1, 0}, 1},
						}
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Next we will write the test itself.

						```go
						func TestFunc(t *testing.T) {
							for _, tt := range tests {
								got := add.Do(tt.in[0], tt.in[1])
								expected := tt.out
								if got != tt.out {
									t.Errorf("Error! Got %d, expected %d", got, expected)
								}

							}
						}

						```

					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Now we will write the code that satisfies the test.

						```go
						package add

						//Do runs a test func given two integers
						func Do(a int, b int) int {
							return a + b
						}
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						And finally we can run the test and see how we go!
						```bash
						$ go test ./...
						?   	github.com/nii236/gotraining/go-crashcourse	[no test files]
						?   	github.com/nii236/gotraining/go-crashcourse/concurrency	[no test files]
						?   	github.com/nii236/gotraining/go-crashcourse/hello	[no test files]
						?   	github.com/nii236/gotraining/go-crashcourse/serve	[no test files]
						?   	github.com/nii236/gotraining/go-crashcourse/structs	[no test files]
						ok  	github.com/nii236/gotraining/go-crashcourse/testing	0.005s
						```
