# Go Crash Course

This is a presentation I threw together for a demo of Go I need to do in a few weeks. The following resources were used to build this presentation:

- Reveal.js
- Go 1 Hour Workshop
- Go Training
- Go By Example
- Go Tour
- Go Programming Language

This is all static and all the dependencies are vendored in this repo.
