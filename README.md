# Go Crash Course

This is a presentation I threw together for a demo of Go I need to do in a few weeks. The following resources were used to build this presentation:

- [Reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/)
- [Go 1 Hour Workshop](https://github.com/corylanou/go-1-hour-boot-camp/)
- [Go Training](https://github.com/ardanlabs/gotraining)
- [Go By Example](https://gobyexample.com/)
- [Go Tour](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1)
- [Go Programming Language](http://www.gopl.io/)

This is all static and all the dependencies are vendored in this repo.
